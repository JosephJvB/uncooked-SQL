# Joe tries:
- SQL-in-js using pg-promise library
- Learning HOC's, injecting props into react components

Oh and Im doing it all from a terminal-editor called Micro for the sake of trying new things.

Hey maybe I should be using this library, I like its docs https://node-postgres.com/features/pooling

It's amazing how slow going it is to get anything at all. I made so many dumb moves just getting pg-promise to respond to me with 1+1.
I was trying the npm package mysql first.. but I have a bunch of psql things already on my machine so I said what the hell and used a pg library instead.
Ah so in retrospect, the mysql package didnt work so well since I dont have a mysql database to establish a connection to. That makes sense
