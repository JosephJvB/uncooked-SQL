Wanted to do something code-y this evening. I have a new keyboard to play around on.

RAW SQL queries from a JS web-server was the idea.
So I found [PG-PROMISE](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise)

Oh and Im doing it all from a terminal-editor called Micro for the sake of trying new things.

It's amazing how slow going it is to get anything at all. I made so many dumb moves just getting pg-promise to respond to me with 1+1.
I was trying the npm package mysql first.. but I have a bunch of psql things already on my machine so I said what the hell and used a pg library instead.
